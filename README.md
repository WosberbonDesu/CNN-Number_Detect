# CNN-Number_Detect
convolutional neural network model for recognizing numbers
[![forthebadge made-with-python](http://ForTheBadge.com/images/badges/made-with-python.svg)](https://www.python.org/)
# Neural Network
## Built-in code file named Neural Network number where the convolutional neural network is built
## if you want to create your own model
## open and use this code also don't forget to import the data you will train your model with
## After creating your model Run code named video cap this way ai will be able to guess the numbers you show from your camera
## to increase the accuracy of the model you can add new neural networks
## with early stopping and removal methods  you can make the model much better
## I added the model I trained here, you can use it too you don't need to do anything extra just video_cap code you should run it
## You can send me your model-related problems and problems.
